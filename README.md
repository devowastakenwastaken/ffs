# ffs
It's just a file sorter.
(P.S FFS does not stand for 'for f*cks sake' but rather 'fun file sorter'.)

# Usage
Upon opening, you will be greeted by a terminal window.
You enter the folder that you want to sort in the format:
DriveLetter:\FolderName
MAKE SURE TO USE BACKSLASHES (\) INSTEAD OF FORWARDSLASHES (/)!

# Correct syntax
DriveLetter:\FolderName\OptionalSecondFolder\ETC

# Incorrect syntax
FolderName (on its own)

If you are sorting a drive;
DriveName (rather than the letter)
