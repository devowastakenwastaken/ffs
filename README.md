It's just a file sorter.
(P.S FFS does not stand for 'for f*cks sake' but rather 'fun file sorter'.)

# Usage
Upon opening, you will be greeted by a terminal window.
You enter the folder that you want to sort in the format DriveLetter:\FolderName. MAKE SURE TO USE BACKSLASHES (\) INSTEAD OF FORWARDSLASHES (/)!
